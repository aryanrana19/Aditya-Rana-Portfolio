                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The Cold Weather Air-Based Heating System (CWABHS)</span> significantly advances the Extended Cold Weather Clothing System
                (ECWCS) by reducing clothing layers required for optimal thermal comfort. It integrates flexible piping and a portable
                air heater above existing layers to distribute heated air uniformly. Smart, personalized controls allow users to adjust
                temperatures based on preferences and conditions, ensuring adaptability and efficiency. Testing confirms CWABHS provides
                reliable thermal comfort, enhances mobility, and maintains energy efficiency, making it a practical solution for cold
                environments.</p>

                <p>Designing an electric trike as a mechanical engineer involves combining innovation, functionality, and
                    sustainability to
                    meet modern transportation demands. With urbanization driving congestion and pollution, electric trikes provide
                    an
                    eco-friendly alternative, offering zero emissions, reduced noise, and smooth acceleration. Key design priorities
                    include
                    optimizing the frame, suspension, and braking systems for performance, safety, and ergonomic comfort. Features
                    like
                    intuitive controls, stability systems, and enhanced visibility ensure a secure, user-friendly experience. Using
                    lightweight materials, efficient batteries, and regenerative braking minimizes environmental impact.
                    Collaboration
                    across disciplines integrates mechanical, electrical, and software components seamlessly. Electric trikes are
                    especially
                    beneficial for seniors, individuals with disabilities, and novice riders, delivering stability and accessibility
                    for
                    diverse urban populations.</p>

                <img src="assets/Minor Project.jpg" alt="Minor Project">
                <p>This project focuses on the meticulous design and development of a multipurpose cooking Chulha (stove) that optimizes
                energy use, enhances durability, and ensures user-centric functionality for both rural and urban households.
                Incorporating advanced thermal engineering and ergonomic design, the Chulha (stove) maximizes fuel efficiency, minimizes
                emissions and ensures robust performance under varied conditions. Its innovative features reduce fuel consumption,
                promote cost savings, and support environmental sustainability by lowering carbon emissions.</p>
